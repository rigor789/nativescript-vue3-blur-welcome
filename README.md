# NativeScript-Vue 3.x Welcome Screen Demo

This is a tiny demo showing a cool looking welcome screen, with a blurred button implemented using a native library directly in our TypeScript files.

## Android only

Since this is a quick demo I threw together in ~30 minutes, I haven't done the BlurView implementation for iOS.

I would probably use [@nstudio/nativescript-blur](https://github.com/nstudio/nativescript-plugins/blob/main/packages/nativescript-blur/README.md) in an actual project setup. (Or spend more time properly implementing the BlurView included in this demo).
